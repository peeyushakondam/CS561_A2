# CS561_A2

The goal of the project was to connect a backend mock to an EC2 instance. The following actions must be taken in order to do this: 

1. Create an instance and start it up. 
2. Configure the inbound rules for the Security group to apply to all users (HTTP, TCP, SSH) 
3. Use EC2 Instance Connect to connect to the instance. 
4. Verify that node and npm are installed. Then execute the main program (app.js) 
5. Copy the Public IPv4 address from the instances page and attach port:3000 to the end of the address in the web browser, followed by data/2.5/weather. 
6. We'd be able to see the weather results now.
